# openscad
My miscellaneous OpenSCAD designs

These are generally printed with 0.16 layer height on the Bambu P1S with the 0.4 nozzle using PLA.

The most useful thing is probably mycardlib.scad which is a library for creating boxes of various sizes, and trivial-box.scad is a simple example.

I may add other more involved examples of boxes I've made and other non-boxlib related things with time.
